The goal of the project is to build an open source general finite element solver.
The basic inputs shall be a .msh file generated by Gmsh (http://gmsh.info/), a free 3D finite element mesh generator,  and a weak form of equation.
As now it is written in Octave, an open source high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It's syntax is very close to Matlab.
The Project is a work in progress.
