# ProjectFEA
## The goal of the project is to build an open source general finite element Library.  
The basic inputs is a .msh file generated by Gmsh (http://gmsh.info/), a free 3D finite element mesh generator.  
The weak form of can be easily declared in the main.cpp itself. All boundary conditions, Neumann as well as Dirichlet can be delared within the main file.  
The Nodes for Nuemann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are detected on the nodes declared as 'Physical Entities' in gmsh file.  
All the mesh data including physical groups must be declared within one file. For this, after meshing the domain, use 'Export..' option of Gmsh and save as '.msh' file.  
The Project is using Armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net) and Gmsh (gmsh.info/) APIs.   
  
This Project is a work in progress.  
  
ProjectFEA consists of mostly just header files. Hence you will need to include the whole Folder within the Cpp into your source directory.  

## A Few Examples.
A few examples and gmsh files have been provided.  
The included example source codes are, Poisson.cpp, ElasticityExample.cpp and OneElmntVrfy.cpp  

You can run the Poisson example by running,  

    ./Poisson <.msh file> <dimension of the Domain>
    
The .msh file "SampleGmsh/Hexahadral_2.msh" can be used for testing this example. Hence your input will be  
    
    ./Poisson SampleGmsh/Hexahadral_2.msh 3
    
Similary ElasticityExample.cpp can be testing by running,  

    ./ElasticityEx <.msh file> <dimension of the Domain>
    
<img src="Cpp/Pics/Hexahedral_2.png" alt="Poisson">
    
The .msh file "SampleGmsh/Bar.msh" or "SampleGmsh/Bar2.msh" can be used for testing this example. Hence your input will be  

    ./ElasticityEx SampleGmsh/Bar.msh 3
    
<img src="Cpp/Pics/ElasticExTetOrdr3.png" alt="Tetrahedral of Order 3">
    
or   


    ./ElasticityEx SampleGmsh/ElasticExHexOrdr1.png 3
    
<img src="Cpp/Pics/ElasticExTetOrdr3.png" alt="Hexahedral of Order 3">
  
In case of the Bar example, a case of cantilever beam is tested, where a force of 4kN is applied at the end of a (2000mm x 200mm x 60mm) bar with a fixed end at the other side. The force is applied on the surface (200mm x 60mm). Young's modulus is supposed 200 Gpa.  
By using formula delta_L =Pl^3/(3EI) we get 14.8mm deflection.  
The finite element converges to that solution as the order of the elements and the number of nodes are increased.  

## How to Compile.
To compile the code, you need to download the latest Gmsh source code from gmsh.info/ and compile  by typing the following in your Gmsh build directory. This will build a static library of Gmsh.  

    cmake -DDEFAULT=0 -DENABLE_BUILD_LIB=1 -DENABLE_POST=1 -DENABLE_PARSER=1 <path gmsh source directory>
    make lib
    
Copy the libgmsh.a file generated to the folder ProjectFEA/Cpp/libGmshReader/GmshApi/  
The go to your buid directory and type

    cmake <path to source directory>
    make
